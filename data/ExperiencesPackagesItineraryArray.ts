Here, in south-west Ethiopia's awkwardly named “Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region”, bordering Kenya and Sudan, the great Omo River dominates this dry savanna valley, resulting in some of Africa's most well-developed and best-preserved arid-zone riverine forests.",
            "The Omo River rises from the Shewan highlands to the north (much of Ethiopia consists of high-lying mountains and fertile plateaus, despite the impression created by some international media bodies that Ethiopia is predominately desert!). It flows 470 miles (750km), mostly southwards, before entering Lake Turkana (previously Lake Rudolf) near the Kenyan border. Lake Turkana, the world's largest permanent desert lake and also the planet's largest alkaline lake, has no water outflow, so in effect, it's a dead-end for the Omo River. The importance of the Lower Omo Valley has been recognized by UNESCO, which has declared it a cultural World Heritage site. It also contains two massive national parks and several important bird areas.",
            "After departing Kangate, and making our way across the Omo River and into a new tribal area. Here, our tribe of interest is the Karo, another tribe known for its elaborate body and facial paintings. These people live along the east bank of the Omo River and practice flood retreat cultivation, their main crops being maize, sorghum, and beans. Unlike the other tribes, they keep only a small number of cattle due to the prevalence of tsetse flies. Like many of the tribes in the Omo, they paint their bodies and faces with white chalk to prepare for any ceremonies.",

This includes the complete scarification of a man's chest with which to indicate that he has killed an enemy or dangerous animal (Amongst the Karo, killing one's enemies isn't viewed as an act of murder, but as an act of honor!).",
            "This scarification process involves lightly slicing the skin with knives or razor blades and then rubbing ash into the open wounds to produce a permanently raised effect. The Karo women have decoratively scarred abdomens, which are considered sensual and very desirable.",

They are highly ‘superstitious' people, and to this day they consider twins to be babies born outside of wedlock, while children whose upper milk teeth develop before their lower teeth are deemed to be ‘evil' or ‘unclean'.",
            "For this reason, such children are discarded in the bush and simply left to die, as they would rather lose a single child than inflict any disaster upon their community. The Hamar people are also known for one of the most bizarre rituals on Earth. This is when the women allow themselves to be whipped by the male members of their family as a symbol of their love! The scars of such encounters are conspicuously evident on the bodies of all Hamar women.",
            "These women take great pride in their appearance and wear traditional dresses consisting of a brown goatskin skirt adorned with dense vertical rows of red and yellow beads. Their hair is characteristically fixed in dense ringlets with butterfat mixed with red ochre. They also wear many bracelets and necklaces fashioned of beads or metal, depending on their age, wealth, and marital status. The men wear woven cloth wrapped around the waist and many elders wear delicately colored clay head caps that are fashioned into their hair and adorned with an ostrich feather.",
            "As mentioned, the young Hamar men are famous for their “Evangadi dance” and “Bull jumping” ceremony (it is as part of this ceremony that the afore-mentioned whipping occurs). This ritual entails young men who wish to marry jumping over a line of bulls, thereby proving their worth to their intended bride's family. It also signifies their advent into adulthood.

Most famous for the clay lip plates that the women insert in their lower lips, the Mursi are probably one of the last tribes in Africa amongst whom it is still the norm for women to wear these large pottery or wooden discs or plates.",
            "The lip plate (dhebi a tugoin) has become the chief visible distinguishing characteristic of the fascinating Mursi people. A girl's lower lip is cut, typically by her mother or another woman of her settlement, when she reaches the age of 15 or 16. The cut is then held open by a wooden plug until the wound heals. It appears to be up to the individual girl to decide how far to stretch the lip, which she does by inserting progressively larger plugs over several months. Some girls even persevere until their lips can take plates of 5 inches (12 cm) or more in diameter!",
            "The Mursi and their neighbors became part of the Ethiopian State in the final years of the 19th century when Emperor Menelik II established control over the southwestern lowlands bordering Kenya and Sudan. This was an area inhabited by several small tribes with fluid identities, highly adaptable to environmental conditions, and capable of easily absorbing outsiders into their communities. The Mursi as we know them today are the product of a large-scale migratory movement of cattle-herding peoples in the general direction of the Ethiopian highlands. Three separate movements may be distinguished in the recent history of the Mursi, each the result of growing environmental pressure associated with the drying out of the Omo basin over the last 150 – 200 years.",
            "The Mursi attribute overwhelming cultural importance to cattle. Almost every significant social relationship – particularly marriage – is marked and authenticated by exchanging cattle. The “Bridewealth” (ideally consisting of 38 heads of cattle) is handed over by the groom's family to the bride's father, who must meet the demands of a wide range of relatives from different clans. This ensures that cattle are continually redistributed around the community, thereby helping to provide for the long-term economic security of individuals as well as their families.",

            "The tour starts this morning in Addis Ababa. You can choose to arrive by air this morning with Ethiopian Airlines or by another carrier, or you can elect to arrive the previous day and get some rest by having an extra hotel night. If you arrive early enough you can explore the city if you wish. There are plenty of interesting things to see, including Emperor Menelik's tomb, the cathedral, the national museum and the huge and fascinating Mercato open-air market.",

            "We may opt to take a break at Lake Chelekleka on the outskirts of Bishoftu. It is rich in waterbirds, including Great White Pelicans, Common Cranes and many others, but if not we will press on to Lake Koka, often a great site for photographing impressive (and noisy) African Fish Eagles and sometimes the beautiful Black Crowned Crane. There are often so many eagles here that fights over fish break out.",
            "This afternoon we will arrive at Lake Ziway, where we will overnight at a comfortable hotel right at the lakeside. Lake Ziway is a great place for photography, and of course of a kind we will not enjoy while in the Bale or Simien. We can walk out directly onto either of two promontories that start at our hotel and enjoy the spectacle of numerous waterbirds, most of which are highly approachable. (An important aspect of Ethiopia, and one which makes it so good for wildlife photography, is that birds and indeed most creatures are not harmed by local people.)",
            "Large flocks of Great White Pelicans are a feature here and we are likely to get surprisingly close to these huge and impressive birds. Among the many other stars are the jewel-like Malachite Kingfisher, the long-toed African Jacana, the huge Goliath Heron, the strange Hamerkop and the superb Saddle-billed Stork. Additional species we are likely to shoot include White-faced and Fulvous Whistling Ducks, Spur-winged and Egyptian Geese, Hottentot Teal, Pink-backed Pelican, Reed Cormorant, African Darter, African Sacred and Glossy Ibises, Yellow-billed Stork, Black-winged Stilt, Spur-winged Lapwing, Gull-billed and White-winged Terns, Red-eyed Dove and Pied Kingfisher (try and take them hovering).

The grounds of a rather run-down hotel usually hold impressive Greyish Eagle-Owls and many cryptically-coloured Slender-tailed Nightjars, and while looking for these nightbirds we are likely to find and photograph the endemic Black-winged Lovebird and Red-throated Wryneck, as well as Namaqua Dove, White-bellied Go-away-bird, the weird-looking Speckled Mousebird, Little Bee-eater, Eurasian Hoopoe, Black-billed Wood Hoopoe, and colourful Greater Blue-eared, Rüppell's and Superb Starlings.",

These impressive chestnut-coloured antelopes are still common here and the grasslands also feature White-bellied Bustard and the gorgeous Northern Carmine Bee-eater. Eventually, we will arrive at Hawassa, a town situated beside the lake of the same name, where we will overnight.",

Mothers with tiny infants are especially appreciated. Grivet Monkeys also occur here and the more photogenic birds include the delightful little African Pygmy Goose, Squacco Heron, the perky little Black Crake and Woodland Kingfisher. African Spotted Creeper, a very uncommon and patchily-distributed bird, also occurs here, but we cannot honestly claim it will be at the top of most folk's targets!",

The handsome Ethiopian (or Simien) Wolf has had a difficult time in recent decades, suffering from distemper epidemics introduced by domestic dogs (incursions of which have become more common as the region's human population has increased). This is now the world's rarest canid, although, happily, a recent campaign to vaccinate local dogs, organized by the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme has brought about a welcome rebound in the population.",
            "The wolves tend to go around singly or in small groups and during the course of our visit we should have repeated encounters with them, watching them patrol their territories, greet each other, relax or hunt rodents and other prey. While we should be able to see them catch rodents, you can consider yourself lucky if you witness a close-up ‘kill' and likewise, although most packs will have pups this season, getting great photo opportunities with cubs must be considered a real bonus.",
            "The number of rodents here is quite extraordinary, and of course, they provide a bonanza for predators. It is estimated that their density is such that the combined weight of rodents per square kilometre (or about 0.4 square mile) is no less than 4 tons! The great majority on the moorlands (and the main prey species of the Ethiopian Wolf) consist of three Ethiopian endemics: Blick's Grass Rat, Black-clawed Brush-furred Rat and the extraordinary, endangered Giant Mole Rat. The latter, a huge blind rodent with very goofy teeth, is constantly enlarging its burrows to reach new food supplies and we will have some fun trying to sneak up on them to take some photos. They have good hearing and also detect vibrations, so in spite of their blindness, a close approach is not easy!",
            "While the handsome Mountain Nyala is regularly seen on the moorlands, the landscape is open and approaching them closely on foot is often unsuccessful. For far better opportunities we will head for the Bale Mountains National Park headquarters at Dinsho. Here, some of the Nyalas have become unafraid of humans and will allow a close approach, as will Menelik's Bushbucks and especially the ultra-tame Common Warthogs, which one can get to within a couple of meters!",

The park is home to the highest peak in the country, Ras Dashen, which is 4543 meters (14,906ft) above sea level.",

            "In addition to its wonderful scenery and wildlife, the park is also famous for its Afromontane forest, Hypericum woodland, Afromontane grassland and Afro-alpine moorland dominated by Giant Lobelias, Red Hot Pokers, tree heaths, and giant St. John's Wort and African Roses. As you can see, no Ethiopia wildlife photography tour can afford to miss out on the extraordinary Simien!",
            "We will explore the scenic Simien escarpment in order to find the endemic Gelada Baboons. Nicknamed ‘bleeding heart baboon' and ‘lion-monkey' for reasons that will soon be obvious to all, Gelada Baboons are peculiar to Ethiopia and Eritrea, still being numerous in the Simien Mountains. Geladas are mainly vegetarian, living on herbs, grasses and roots, but they also eat insects including locusts. Geladas live along the rim and steep slopes of the escarpment, which is their refuge when danger threatens.",

The scenery around Chenek is even more awesome than further west near our lodge, with huge peaks, crags and cliffs in the foreground and distant granite domes below the Simien escarpment. Here we can look for the endemic Walia Ibex. As well as photographic opportunities with the ibex, we will also be hoping for an encounter with the handsome Ethiopian (or Simien) Wolf, a declining species that still occurs regularly around Chenek.",

The date of its foundation is unknown, but it was already important by the 13th century and later became the capital of the Adal Sultanate and its successor state, the Emirate of Harar, in the 16th century.",

The various legends about feeding include stories that they were publicly fed porridge so that they could act as impromptu soothsayers through their style of eating it, or that they were fed to discourage them from eating livestock or even people during droughts, or even that Muslim saints communicated with their clan leaders and persuaded them not to do harm in return for handouts.",
            "In any event, it seems the feeding had long since stopped before it was revived in the 1950s or 1960s, perhaps through nothing more than chance encounters with hyenas and the inclination to see if they would accept food. Since then it has become a nightly event at Harar, with two senior ‘Hyena Men', Mulugeta Wolde-Mariam and Yusuf Mume Saleh, and their assistants, operating at two different sites outside the walls.",
            "Spotted Hyenas have a fearsome reputation, only partly because of their manner and appearance, but also because of their ruthless hunting style in the wild, so seeing them come close to humans and take meat from small sticks held in what seems a tiny hand, next to their huge muzzles, or even a human mouth, seems pretty awesome to the rest of us! Not only do the hyenas take food but they ‘lovingly' rest their huge paws on the Hyena Man's back or head and generally behave like large friendly dogs!",

If you are so inclined you can get down low for better angles (so far they have never eaten anyone!) and if you are really brave you will get the chance to feed them yourself.",

The walled old city dates back to around the 16th century and is a fascinating warren of small alleyways, markets, mosques, and ancient buildings. Harar is widely considered to be the 4th holiest city in Islam, after Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, but today it is famed for its tolerance of other faiths, and Harar beer, brewed naturally enough by Christians, is widely available. It is said that there are 99 mosques in Harar, chiming with the 99 known names of Allah, but in reality, there are ‘only' 86. Harar is a wonderful place for photography, especially if you get out early while the light is at its best.",

Feeding the Yellow-billed Kites is a recent development, not some ancient tradition, but it is fun to watch and photograph the kites swooping down and often squabbling in mid-air over small pieces of meat from the ‘Kite Man's' hands.",

Your first birding stop is at Lake Chelekcheka, an excellent site for migrant ducks and waders. Regular species encountered here include Northern Pintail, Northern Shoveler, Garganey, Eurasian Teal, Tufted Duck, Black-tailed Godwit and Temminck's Stint. Sorting through the rafts of ducks and other migrants can be very challenging due to the distraction caused by the sheer number of species moving through the scrubby vegetation near the lake edge! Common cranes often roost in staggering numbers on the far side of the water, and we may see them flying off to forage in huge, noisy flocks. ",

The woodlands around the lake also teem with birds and again it may prove difficult to keep up with the seemingly endless flow of lifers! Blue-breasted Bee-eater, Black-billed Barbet, Common Redstart, Eurasian Blackcap, Red-throated Wryneck, Dark-capped Yellow Warbler, Rüppell's Robin-Chat, Western Black-headed Batis, Beautiful Sunbird, Rüppell's Weaver and a diverse variety of waterbirds, especially deep water diving ducks, can be seen here. Thereafter, the steep-sided Lake Bishoftu offers superb birding. Maccoa and Ferruginous Ducks, Southern Pochard, Singing Cisticola, gorgeous Tacazze Sunbird, Mocking Cliff Chat, Abyssinian Wheatear, Little Rock Thrush and flocks of Black-winged Lovebird are just some of our targets here!

Roadside stops en route could produce several endemics and other species, including White-collared Pigeon, Moorland Chat, Ground scraper Thrush (of the distinctive, endemic race simensis), Blanford's Lark, Blue-winged Goose, and the highly sought-after Spot-breasted Lapwing. At the park headquarters in Dinsho, we may find the colorful Chestnut-naped Francolin, the Abyssinian Owl, the secretive Abyssinian Ground Thrush, the vocal Abyssinian Catbird, and the endemic White-backed Black Tit. Mammals that we may encounter include Mountain Nyala, now entirely restricted to the Bale Mountain massif, Menelik's Bushbuck, and Warthog, unusual at this high altitude.",

            "Upon reaching this unique plateau, we will be driving on Africa's highest road - passing close to the summit of Ethiopia's second-highest mountain. This habitat is termed ‘Afro-alpine moorland' and is characterised by Giant Lobelias that tower like monolithic giants over the rich tussock grasslands and extensive cushions of yellow Everlasting flowers. This site is an Important Bird Area of immense significance, supporting seven globally threatened species and nearly all of Ethiopia's highland biome species. The plateau holds the only Afro tropical breeding populations of Ruddy Shelduck, Golden Eagle, and Red-billed Chough. We will also search for Wattled Ibis, Chestnut-naped and Moorland Francolins, Rouget's Rail (particularly common and confiding here), Blue-winged Goose, Spot-breasted Lapwing, African Snipe, Wattled Crane, Thekla's Lark, Abyssinian Longclaw, Red-breasted Wheatear, Moorland Chat and flocks of endemic Ethiopian Siskins.",
            "These grasslands are estimated to support an incredible biomass of 4,000kg (8,800lb) of rodents per hectare. This obviously attracts an array of raptors and we should see Augur and Mountain Buzzards and, if we are lucky, the rare Golden Eagle. They share this abundant food source with the plateau's most celebrated resident, the Ethiopian or Simien Wolf, crowned with the unenviable title of “the world's rarest canid”. Watching these vibrantly coloured animals, most closely related to the Grey Wolf exhibiting their hunting prowess whilst pouncing on Giant Mole Rats (another endemic to the Sanetti Plateau) is surely among Africa's greatest wildlife experiences. We should enjoy excellent photographic opportunities in this unique montane habitat.",
            "This afternoon, we will return to our lodge and enjoy an opportunity to bird a part of the vast Harenna forest, the largest intact forest block in Ethiopia, and the largest protected Afro-alpine forest on the continent. It still supports populations of Lion and the only surviving forest-dwelling African Wild Dogs. Although it's unlikely that we will see either of these species, the descent through this breathtakingly beautiful, moss-draped forest is inspirational.",

The bird is named after an Italian Prince, its hapless discoverer, who was killed by an elephant soon after collecting the type specimen in the 1890s. It took another 50 years before explorers saw the turaco again, and only in the 1970s was anything revealed about this bird.

This area of the Acacia savanna is characterised by giant red termite mounds (some towering 5m above the plains!) and both these birds seem to be associated in some way with these marvels of natural architecture. The social Bushcrow (or Zavattariornis) was only discovered in 1938 and its affinities have yet to be established with certainty.

            "Gondar is known as the “Camelot of Ethiopia.” This city was founded by Emperor Fasilidas around 1635 and is famous for its medieval castles and ornately decorated churches – in particular, Debra Berhan Selassie. Gondar is probably the most immediately impressive of Ethiopia's major ex-capitals and is now one of the country's largest cities. Flanked by twin mountain streams at an altitude of more than 2,300m (7,600ft), Gondar commands spectacular views over farmlands to the gleaming waters of Lake Tana 35 kilometres (22 miles) to the south. This marvellous city really is a sight to behold, and the ancient castle-like structures give a sense of the city's age and the kind of civilisation that once occupied the area.",

This comfortable lodge will be our overnight stop before you head into the mountains of the Simien Mountains National Park. This World Heritage Site, with its jagged skyline and blocks of volcanic core rock, was once described as a place where “Greek gods play chess” – and in the next few days you will see for yourselves just how apt this statement happens to be!

            "hese will prove to be an exciting two days as you explore the rugged Simien Mountains in search of the magnificent Walia Ibex and Gelada. The ibex, a large goat-like creature, sports a monstrous set of horns and inhabits the rugged rocky and grassy slopes of these seldom-visited mountains. The numbers of these animals are gradually recovering now that they are protected and the population is estimated to be approximately 500 animals, up from 200 in the late 1990s. Troops of Geladas, up to four hundred strong, also thrive here and we will spend quality time observing these unique and fascinating primates. With long woolly capes, tasselled tails, bare red chests and an arrogant swagger, these last relics of once widespread grass-eating baboons are now endemic to the highlands of Ethiopia.",
            "The Geladas roost on the massive cliffs that dominate the park, but spend their days hunched over the grasses that form the bulk of their diet. Despite sporting massive canines (the largest in proportion to body size of any mammal!), Geladas are non-aggressive and, with patience, we sometimes find ourselves in and amongst a large troop as they concentrate on their foraging. You may also be treated to a formidable lip-flip – the imposing grimace put on by Geladas to reveal their impressive upper jaw and canines, but more likely you will be completely ignored as they go about their daily business.",
            "Interestingly, Geladas are extremely vocal, being able to pronounce all nouns and five vowels! Other attractions in the area include several species of endemic birds such as Rouget's Rail, Erckel's and Chestnut-naped Francolins, Spot-breasted Lapwing, Thick-billed Raven, Abyssinian Longclaw, White-billed Starling, Ethiopian Siskin and the rare and localised Ankober Serin, as well as an important population of the spectacular Bearded Vulture.",
            "Ethiopian Wolf may also be found parading around this beautiful landscape, although they have suffered due to various diseases passed on from domestic dogs and are usually only restricted to more remote areas of the park. Serval, the Menelik's sub-species of Bushbuck, Klipspringer, Guereza, Abyssinian sub-species of Rock Hyrax and Golden Jackal are further mammalian possibilities. Overnight in Simien Mountains",

Common Crane often roost in staggering numbers on the far side of the water, and we may see them flying off to forage in huge, noisy flocks.",

The woodlands around the lake also teem with birds and again it may prove difficult to keep up with the seemingly endless flow of lifers! Blue-breasted Bee-eater, Black-billed Barbet, Common Redstart, Eurasian Blackcap, Red-throated Wryneck, Dark-capped Yellow Warbler, Ruppell's Robin-Chat, Western Black-headed Batis, Beautiful Sunbird, Rüppell's Weaver and a diverse variety of waterbirds, especially deep water diving ducks, can be seen here.",

We should also see Great White Pelican, White-breasted and Reed Cormorants, Hamerkop, African Sacred Ibis, Black-headed, Grey-hooded, and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, and sometimes the massively-equipped Thick-billed Raven squabbling over the fish remains.",

Rugged hillsides en route may hold a few surprises for us, and some dedicated searching may produce the mackinderi race of Cape Eagle-Owl, while wetter areas hold Rouget's Rail, Groundscraper Thrush (of the distinctive, endemic simensis subspecies), Blue-winged Goose, and smart Spot-breasted Lapwing.",

This obviously attracts an array of raptors and we should see Steppe and Golden Eagles, Augur Buzzard, and elegant Pallid Harrier courting over this green sea.

            "The mountain range is comprised of several major plateaus divided by a network of river valleys that span for miles, however, it is only the western side of the range that has been designated a National Park and it is here that you will focus your attention single dirt road runs through the Park from your lodge to Bwahit Pass, allowing you to access the most scenic and rewarding sites around Sankaber and Chenek, where you will be on the lookout for three of Ethiopia’s largest endemic mammals.",
            "With an estimated population of over 15,000 individuals, the Simien Mountains is considered a stronghold for the Gelada Baboon; a magnificent beast possessed of an imposing golden mane and distinctive heart-shaped red chest. Unique amongst primates, the Gelada Baboon feeds almost exclusively on grass and is considered the most sociable of African monkeys, with a harem-based social structure that is widely regarded to be second in complexity, only to humans.",
            "With enormous canines and a maned coat, not unlike a Lion, one could be forgiven for thinking that you would need to give them a very wide berth. However, they are in fact remarkably tolerant of their human cousins and will often allow you to approach within a few meters, providing superb photographic opportunities.",
            "Social units typically number around 30-50 individuals, however, in the late afternoon as dusk approaches, the baboons retreat to the safety of the escarpment edge and will often come together in mega-herds of over 500 animals. Set against a magnificent backdrop of vast plains and isolated pinnacles, this has to be one of Africa’s most impressive wildlife spectacles.",
            "Restricted entirely to the Simien Mountains, the endangered Walia Ibex is considered to be Ethiopia’s rarest endemic mammal, with the population believed to be in the region of 500 individuals. Favoring very steep, rocky cliff areas between 2,500m and 4,500m high, with its chocolate-brown coloration it can prove remarkably well camouflaged when set against the dark cliffs.",
            "Males can weigh as much as 125 kg (180-280lb) and have very large horns that curve backward, reaching lengths up to 110cm (43 in). Whilst the females are smaller and lighter in color, the males have a distinguished black beard that lengthens and thickens with age, setting them apart from the females.",
            "Walia Ibex are prolific grazers and will feed on a diverse range of vegetation, from scrub and herbs to lichens, and are particularly active first thing in the morning when they frequently ascend the escarpment cliffs to graze on the plateau. The area around Chenek not only holds some of the most spectacular scenery in the Park but is also something of a hotspot for the species and you will certainly try your luck here, hoping to photograph this magnificent animal in the morning light.",
            "Sadly, following a rabies epidemic several years ago, the last of the ‘Simien Big Three,’ the Ethiopian Wolf, is also the rarest, with the Simien population now believed to be as low as 40 individuals. Nevertheless, Ethiopian Wolves have been seen and heard in the Simiens and you will always be on the lookout. It is also worth noting that you will also have an excellent chance of seeing this beautiful canid later on in the tour in the Bale Mountains.",
            "Less well known for its birds, the Simien Mountains still has some very interesting prospects, with over 180 species having been recorded in the range and some star species offering fantastic photographic opportunities, including Lammergeiers, Augur Buzzards, and with a little luck, Lanner Falcons.",
            "Endemic White-billed Starlings are a common sight, frequently found clinging to rocky gorges, whilst White-winged Black Tit and Abyssinian Catbird prefer the dense cover of Juniper Forest.",

Virtually uninhabited, they are almost entirely unspoiled and were set aside as a national park in order to protect the Mountain Nyala which is found nowhere else in the world. Of volcanic origin like the more famous Simiens in the north, the Bale Mountains may not be as spectacular, but they do possess an exceptional beauty and charm which can be likened to that of the Scottish Highlands. They are green and spacious, decorated with rocky peaks and crags, numerous small lakes, extensive heathland, magnificent cloud forests, and bogs! Within the park is Mount Batu, at 14,360 feet one of the highest mountains in Ethiopia. The flora is fascinating and so is the fauna.",
            "The park remains a stronghold for the beautiful Ethiopian Wolf, which roams the plateau in small groups and is regularly seen, whilst Klipspringers, the endemic Stark’s Hare, Warthogs, Rock Hyrax, the peculiar endemic Giant Mole-Rat, and the verminous but characterful Grass Rats and Swamp Rats (the main prey of the Ethiopian Wolf) are to be added to those species already mentioned.",
            "Amongst an interesting collection of upland birds, we are likely to see eleven of Ethiopia's 29 endemics: Blue-winged Goose, Rouget's Rail, Spot-breasted Plover, White-collared Pigeon, Black-winged Lovebird, Golden-backed Woodpecker, and Abyssinian Long claw, Abyssinian Catbird, White-backed Tit, Black-headed Siskin and Thick-billed Raven!",
            "With two full days to explore the area, you are likely to focus the majority of your time on the plateau where little lakes, extensive grasslands, and the weird spikes of primeval-looking Giant Lobelias and Red-Hot Pokers provide a wonderful Afro-alpine habitat in which to observe and photograph the wolves. You will typically take the approach of driving slowly across the plateau until you encounter a wolf. The wolves are usually quite comfortable around the vehicle, but it has the disadvantage of being quite high up, and the likelihood is that you will spend a significant amount of time observing and photographing the wolves on foot.",
            "This method requires a good degree of stealth and patience but can be hugely rewarding, and you will likely find yourselves refining your methods over the duration of your stay. The wolves are usually very active during the day, and you have a good chance of observing them displaying a wide range of behaviors. With rodents making up the vast majority of their diet, they have to hunt frequently and you have an excellent chance of witnessing and photographing this fascinating behavior.",
            "In addition to providing an important food source for the Ethiopian Wolves, the large numbers of rodent species on the plateau also attract many species of birds of prey that include wintering Spotted, Imperial, and other Aquila eagles, as well as almost all of Ethiopia's vulture species. Wattled Crane and Montane Francolin are two resident bird species that we are likely to encounter, alongside endemic Rouget's Rail, Spot-breasted Plover, and Blue-winged Goose.",

The date of its foundation is unknown, but it was already important by the 13th century and later became the capital of the Adal Sultanate and its successor state, the Emirate of Harar, in the 16th century.",
            "Quite how the Hararis started feeding Spotted Hyenas is lost in legend, but it does seem they were tolerated and indeed encouraged in the city as nocturnal scavengers as far back as the 16th century, as low doorways were built at that time in the city walls to accommodate them! The various legends about feeding include stories that they were publicly fed porridge so that they could act as impromptu soothsayers through their style of eating it, or that they were fed to discourage them from eating livestock or even people during droughts, or even that Muslim saints communicated with their clan leaders and persuaded them not to do harm in return for handouts.",
            "In any event, it seems the feeding had long since stopped before it was revived in the 1950s or 1960s, perhaps through nothing more than chance encounters with hyenas and the inclination to see if they would accept food. Since then it has become a nightly event at Harar, with two senior ‘Hyena Men’, Mulugeta Wolde-Mariam and Yusuf Mume Saleh, and their assistants, operating at two different sites outside the walls.",
            "Spotted Hyenas have a fearsome reputation, only partly because of their manner and appearance, but also because of their ruthless hunting style in the wild, so seeing them come close to humans and take meat from small sticks held in what seems a tiny hand, next to their huge muzzles, or even a human mouth, seems pretty awesome to the rest of us! Not only do the hyenas take food but they ‘lovingly’ rest their huge paws on the Hyena Man’s back or head and generally behave like large friendly dogs!",
            "As well as being able to take photographs, at close range, of the Hyena Men and their nightly ‘guests’ from the surrounding forests (where the hyenas live a perfectly normal life for 23 hours a day), we will also be able to get great shots of them lurking in the background, resting before they feed or prowling in sinister fashion. If you are so inclined you can get down low for better angles (so far they have never eaten anyone!) and if you are really brave you will get the chance to feed them yourself.",

The walled old city dates back to around the 16th century and is a fascinating warren of small alleyways, markets, mosques, and ancient buildings. Harar is widely considered to be the 4th holiest city in Islam, after Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, but today it is famed for its tolerance of other faiths, and Harar beer, brewed naturally enough by Christians, is widely available. It is said that there are 99 mosques in Harar, chiming with the 99 known names of Allah, but in reality, there are ‘only’ 86. Harar is a wonderful place for photography, especially if you get out early while the light is at its best.",

Journey through its diverse landscapes, from lush plains to the captivating desert-like terrain in the south and east.",

These incredible creatures belong to a distinct subspecies called Loxodonta africana orleansi, found exclusively in the Horn of Africa. The park also shelters the elusive black-maned Abyssinian lion, swift cheetahs resembling graceful greyhounds, and a variety of antelope species including greater and lesser kudu. Keep an eye out for the charismatic Hamadryas baboon and an array of captivating dry-country birds, such as the endemic Salvadori's serin.",
            "With approximately 200 elephants residing in Babile, they migrate between the Erer and Gobelle river valleys, occasionally venturing beyond the sanctuary to the western ridge of the Gobelle Valley. For the best wildlife sightings, plan your visit during the late rainy season from June to September when the elephants gather in the Upper Erer Valley, just 40 kilometers away from Harar. In the afternoon drive back to Harar overnight.",

            "We will spend the morning at Awash National Park. The terrain is mostly a mosaic of grassland and acacia scrub, but the Awash River flows through the area and supports some thin strips of riverine forest in places. A distinct advantage of Awash (and indeed all national parks we visit in Ethiopia) compared to many other African parks is that one is allowed to get out of the vehicles and photograph on foot owing to the virtual absence of dangerous mammals. Awash holds some interesting mammals, including Olive Baboon, the delightful little Salt’s Dikdik, and the handsome Beisa Oryx. With a bit of luck, we will also encounter Northern Lesser Kudu.",
            "Birdlife is rich and varied (over 400- species have been recorded from Awash) and among the most appealing photographic targets are the huge Lappet-faced Vulture, Tawny Eagle, Pallid and Montagu’s Harriers, Pygmy and Lanner Falcons, Kori, Buff-crested and White-bellied Bustards, Black-headed Lapwing, Chestnut-bellied Sandgrouse, Blue-naped Mousebird, the superb Abyssinian Roller, the wonderful Northern Carmine Bee-eater (which sometimes uses the backs of Kori Bustards or even Somali Ostriches as a convenient lookout!), Northern Red-billed and Eastern Yellow-billed Hornbills, and the lovely Rosy-patched Bushshrike (pairs often duet together).",
