Step inside, and the atmospheric interior will captivate you with its elaborate and well-preserved paintings dating back to the late 19th century.

Thought to date back to around 1515, the fort's enigmatic design and significant stature stir intrigue and speculation. Some believe it may have been a part of the mysterious medieval city of Barara.
